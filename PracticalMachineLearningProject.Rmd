This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.






# Prepare the datasets
# The training data for this project are available here:
trainingUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
# read file
training <- read.csv(url(trainingUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

# The test data are available here:
testingUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
# read file
testing <- read.csv(url(testingUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

# With qualitative response variable I have to leave regression models out
# and focus more appropriate modeling techniques. From these I chose to try 
# tree approaches:lda, rpart and fandom forest

Linear discriminant analysis applies Bayes theorem to classifying observations into the most probable class. The model is quite similar to more familiar logistic regression. Rpart is implemention to apply Classification and Regression Trees developed mostly by Breiman et al 1984. 

In random forest approach number of decision trees are constructed on bootstrapped training samples. Approach is randon in a sense that in splitting a random sample of predictors is chosen as candidates to further splitting from the full set of variables. Main note is that with this approach majority of variables are always excluded from the splitting procedure.   

# Caret has as a default resampling scheme the bootstrap.
# linear discriminant analysis
